# Data and the Cloud

## Overview

### Welcome

Welcome to the Nectar Research Cloud **Data and the Cloud** curriculum. In this Curriculum we've put together a series of tutorials that focus on dat. We will be building on the skills from the Cloud Starter curriculum.  

positive
: This curriculum is technical in nature. You will learn *how* to use the cloud, not *why*. It is also entry-level: you'll learn *one* (easy) way of doing some things, not *all*. 

### What you'll learn

- Moving data (sftp/rsync)
- Volume stores
- Object Store
- Accessing open data

### What you'll need

- Have completed our Cloud Starter, or bring equivalent skills

-
