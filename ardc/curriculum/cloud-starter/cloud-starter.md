# Cloud Starter Series

## Welcome

Welcome to the Nectar Research Cloud **Cloud Starter series**. In this series we've put together all the tutorials that you need to get started using the Cloud, no prior cloud knowledge required. 

positive
: **Tutorial Series**
In this tutorial series we will point you to a number of our tutorials, and occasionally we'll add some addtional information. We recommend you follow all these tutorials in order. 

positive
: This curriculum is technical in nature. You will learn *how* to use the cloud, not *why*. It is also entry-level: you'll learn *one* (easy) way of doing some things, not *all*. 

### What you'll learn

- **Prerequisites**
  Public-Private keypair and Security Groups
- **Launching and connecting**
  Launching and connecting to your Virtual Machine (VM)
- Using the **command line** and **installing/updating software** on your VM
- **Changing instances**
  Rebooting, Resizing, Rebuilding and Deleting
- **Working with allocations**
  Allocation Management: requests and expiry.

### What you'll need

- An account on the Nectar Research Cloud, or the AAF Access to get one. 
- Basic computer skills
- [Terminal software](https://support.ehelp.edu.au/support/solutions/articles/6000223964-terminal-software).

## Next Steps

In this Tutorial Series you have learnt the basics of cloud computing in the Nectar Research Cloud. We hope you have enjoyed learning and have the skills  and confidence to run a basic Virtual Machine in the cloud, install the software that you need and do your research.

From here you can make things *easier* (check out our tutorial on Applications for instance), or *better* (e.g. add Volume Storage and Move your data around) or much *more sophisticated* (e.g. implementing Advanced Networking).
