# Allocation Management

## Overview

*Allocations, Quota, Resources, Accounts, Projects...* These are some of the words that we use here at Nectar to help you and other Nectar users organise access to the Nectar Research Cloud and its resources.

Making the most of your use of the Nectar Research Cloud requires that you familiarise yourself with this language and with the associated processes. 

Nectar Cloud resources are granted to you in periods of up to a year. An automated expiry process will recover unused and unclaimed resources and recovered resources can then be granted out to researchers just like yourself.

: **Warning**
Familiarise yourself with the expiry process, to prevent surprise deletions of your hard work and data. 

negative
: **Antarctica and Amazon** (te)
The  Expiry Bot does not know of your field trips to Antarctica or the Amazon rainforest, or any other places where wifi-access or your attention to emails may be limited. Make sure you have arranged extensions for your projects if you happen to be away for extended periods (or delegate your project manager role to another user). 



 

### What you'll learn

- Understanding allocations, projects, resources and quota
- Requesting and Amending allocations
- Allocation expiry

### What you'll need

- A Nectar Research Cloud account, or access to the AAF to get one. 

## Accounts and Personal Trial (pt) projects

The first time you log on to the dashboard, Nectar creates two things your *Account* and a *Personal Trial (pt)* project. Your account is tied to your emailaddress, while your personal trial is named pt-*xyz* (where *xyz* is a number). The two are closely related, but they are not the same thing.

### Your Nectar Account

- account related things, eg
  - email, key pairs, passwords

### Your pt-project

- (pt-)project related things, e.g.
  - security groups
- pt specific things
  - limited resources, no extension
  - no multi user management
  - no questions asked
  - useful for trialing or indeed completing our Nectar tutorials

> Any researcher who logs on to the web Dashboard can immediately have access to a small **Project Trial** allocation (2 instances and 2 cores for 3 months). A *Project* provides access to a certain allocation of resources. Project Trials have names like *pt-8637*. Within your default allocation you can run:
>
> - a medium (two core) VM, or
> - two small (single core) VMs.
>
> You can run VMs of various sizes in the cloud, from one to 16 cores, and up to hundreds of VMs. However to obtain such a larger allocation you need to submit an allocation request through the web Dashboard. We will talk about this later in this Module.
